# Word Guess Game

The player is presented with a hangman graphic and a line of "_" indicating how many letters are in the word to be guessed. The user enters letters one at a time and if the letter matchesa letter in the word, the "_" are replaced by the letter. If the letter is used multiple times in the word, all instances are filled out on the first occasion the letter is chosen without needing to select the letter again. Letters that are not contained in the word are indicated in a list. Failed letter attempts will reduce the number of guesses available. Each failure also increases the amount of hang man displayed. The game is won if the word is completed before the failed letter attempts reaches 15. If the number of failed attempts reaches 15, the hangman picture is completed and the game is lost. A tally of the number of wins and losses is kept up to date while the browser tab is open.
